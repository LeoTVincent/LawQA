        <em>Q:</em> Define Dower. Explain the Various Kinds of Dower<br><br>

        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>SYNOPSIS</strong><br>
        1. Introduction to Dower (Mahr)<br>
        2. Definition of Dower<br>
        3. Nature and Importance of Dower<br>
        4. Legal Characteristics of Dower<br>
        5. Classification of Dower under Muslim Law:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Specified Dower (Mahr-e-Musamma)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Proper Dower (Mahr-e-Misl)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. Prompt Dower (Mahr-e-Mu’ajjal)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Deferred Dower (Mahr-e-Muwajjal)<br>
        6. Remedies for Non-Payment of Dower<br>
        7. Important Case Laws<br>
        8. Conclusion<br><br>

        <strong>1. Introduction to Dower (Mahr):</strong><br>
        Marriage (Nikah) under Muslim law is a civil contract. Dower or "Mahr" is a unique obligation imposed on the
        husband as a mark of respect and protection for the wife.<br><br>

        <strong>2. Definition of Dower:</strong><br>
        Dower is a sum of money or property payable by the husband to the wife either by agreement or by law. <br>
        <em>According to Hedaya:</em> “Mahr is a sum of money or other property which becomes payable by the husband to
        the wife as a mark of respect towards her.”<br><br>

        <strong>3. Nature and Importance of Dower:</strong><br>
        • Not a consideration for marriage, but a legal obligation.<br>
        • A wife’s legal and enforceable right.<br>
        • Entitled even if not specified in the contract.<br>
        • Acts as a form of security and protection for the wife.<br><br>

        <strong>4. Legal Characteristics of Dower:</strong><br>
        • Payable only to the wife.<br>
        • Can be money, property, or anything of value.<br>
        • Becomes a legal debt on the husband.<br>
        • Wife can refuse cohabitation until prompt dower is paid.<br>
        • Recoverable from the husband's estate after death.<br><br>

        <strong>5. Classification of Dower under Muslim Law:</strong><br><br>

        <strong>A. Specified Dower (Mahr-e-Musamma):</strong><br>
        • Fixed before or at marriage by agreement between the parties or their guardians.<br>
        • Can be prompt, deferred, or both.<br>
        • Binding on the husband once specified.<br>
        • No minimum fixed under Indian law.<br><br>

        <strong>B. Proper Dower (Mahr-e-Misl):</strong><br>
        • Payable when no dower is fixed or agreement is invalid.<br>
        • Determined based on wife's status (age, family, social standing).<br>
        • Fixed by court, payable after consummation or death.<br><br>

        <strong>C. Prompt Dower (Mahr-e-Mu’ajjal):</strong><br>
        • Payable immediately after marriage or on demand.<br>
        • Wife can deny conjugal rights until it is paid.<br>
        • Recoverable during husband's lifetime or from estate.<br>
        <em>Case Law:</em> <strong>Abdul Kadir v. Salima (1886) ILR 8 All 149</strong> – Wife can refuse cohabitation
        until prompt dower is paid.<br><br>

        <strong>D. Deferred Dower (Mahr-e-Muwajjal):</strong><br>
        • Payable later, usually at divorce or husband's death.<br>
        • Not demandable during marriage unless agreed.<br>
        • Wife may retain husband's property until paid.<br>
        <em>Case Law:</em> <strong>Nasra Begum v. Rizwan Ali, AIR 1980 All 202</strong> – Wife allowed to retain
        possession for unpaid deferred dower.<br><br>

        <strong>6. Remedies for Non-Payment of Dower:</strong><br>
        • Refuse cohabitation (for prompt dower).<br>
        • File civil suit for recovery.<br>
        • Retain husband’s property.<br>
        • Claim from husband's estate after death (as unsecured creditor).<br><br>

        <strong>7. Important Case Laws:</strong><br>
        • <strong>Abdul Kadir v. Salima (1886) ILR 8 All 149</strong> – Dower is a legal obligation.<br>
        • <strong>Hamira Bibi v. Zubaida Bibi (1916) 43 IA 294</strong> – Dower is enforceable like debt.<br>
        • <strong>Nasra Begum v. Rizwan Ali, AIR 1980 All 202</strong> – Wife can retain possession for unpaid
        dower.<br><br>

        <strong>8. Conclusion:</strong><br>
        Dower is a legal and moral obligation that ensures a Muslim woman's dignity and financial protection. It is
        enforceable as debt and helps prevent misuse of marital rights by the husband. Muslim law recognizes various
        forms of dower—each reinforcing the rights and safety of the wife within the marriage contract.

        <strong>[16M Q2]</strong><br>
        <em>Q:</em> Explain Various Sources of Mohammedan Law<br><br>

        <em>Answer:</em><br>

        <strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong><br>
        1. Introduction to Mohammedan Law<br>
        2. Classification of Sources<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Primary Sources (Ancient)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Secondary Sources (Ancient & Modern)<br>
        3. The Quran<br>
        4. The Sunnah (Traditions)<br>
        5. Ijma (Consensus of Jurists)<br>
        6. Qiyas (Analogical Deduction)<br>
        7. Custom (Urf or Aadat)<br>
        8. Equity, Justice, and Good Conscience<br>
        9. Precedent (Judicial Decisions)<br>
        10. Legislation (Statutory Law)<br>
        11. Conclusion<br><br>

        <strong>1. Introduction:</strong><br>
        Mohammedan Law or Muslim Personal Law governs Muslims on matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance,
        maintenance, gifts, etc. It derives authority from divine revelation and juristic interpretation, making it both
        religious and legal in nature.<br><br>

        <strong>2. Classification of Sources:</strong><br>
        <u>Primary Sources:</u> Quran, Sunnah, Ijma, Qiyas<br>
        <u>Secondary Sources:</u> Custom, Equity, Judicial Precedent, Legislation<br><br>

        <strong>3. The Quran:</strong><br>
        The holy book of Islam revealed to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).<br>
        • Contains 500+ legal verses.<br>
        • Supreme and final source of law.<br>
        • Examples: Inheritance laws (Surah An-Nisa 4:11), Iddat (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:228).<br><br>

        <strong>4. The Sunnah:</strong><br>
        Refers to the sayings, actions, and approvals of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).<br>
        • Second only to the Quran in authority.<br>
        • Explains and supplements Quranic text.<br>
        • Categories: Sahih, Hasan, Daif.<br><br>

        <strong>5. Ijma:</strong><br>
        Consensus of jurists on a legal point not addressed directly by Quran or Sunnah.<br>
        • Binding in Sunni law.<br>
        • Example: Fixing punishment for alcohol not detailed in Quran.<br>
        • Supported by Hadith: “My followers will never agree upon what is wrong.”<br><br>

        <strong>6. Qiyas:</strong><br>
        Analogical reasoning – extending law from a known case to a similar one.<br>
        • Accepted in Sunni law.<br>
        • Example: Ban on all intoxicants based on the Quran’s prohibition of wine.<br><br>

        <strong>7. Custom (Urf):</strong><br>
        • Recognized if not contrary to Quran or Sunnah.<br>
        • Must be ancient, certain, and reasonable.<br>
        • Example: Local customs on mehr, inheritance by widows.<br><br>

        <strong>8. Equity, Justice, and Good Conscience:</strong><br>
        • Applied where no precedent or direct authority exists.<br>
        • Especially used by Indian courts.<br>
        • Example: Shah Bano case – maintenance under CrPC Section 125.<br><br>

        <strong>9. Precedent:</strong><br>
        Judicial decisions that interpret or develop Muslim Law.<br>
        • Example: Sarla Mudgal case – conversion to Islam to contract a second marriage ruled void.<br><br>

        <strong>10. Legislation:</strong><br>
        Key statutes modifying Muslim law in India:<br>
        • Shariat Act, 1937<br>
        • Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939<br>
        • Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986<br>
        • Wakf Act, 1995<br><br>

        <strong>11. Conclusion:</strong><br>
        The sources of Mohammedan Law blend divine authority and human reasoning. While Quran and Sunnah are the
        foundation, Ijma and Qiyas offer adaptability. Judicial decisions and legislation have helped modernize the law
        while preserving its spirit.

    <p id='cl1'>
        <strong>[Case Law 1]</strong><br>
        <em>Q:</em> A Hanafi Muslim who has four wives, contracts a fifth wife. Is the fifth marriage valid?<br><br>
        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case concerns the validity of a fifth marriage contracted by a Hanafi Muslim
        male who already has four wives.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> Under Islamic Law (particularly Hanafi law), a Muslim man is permitted to
        have up to four wives simultaneously. The Quran (Surah An-Nisa 4:3) allows polygyny but restricts the number to
        four. Marrying more than four is prohibited.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> Since the individual already has four wives, entering into a fifth
        marriage violates the restriction prescribed in the Quran. Such a marriage is not merely irregular but void
        (batil) under Muslim law because it contravenes the basic limit.<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The fifth marriage contracted by the Hanafi Muslim is void and has no legal
        validity. Any marital rights or obligations arising from it are unenforceable.
    </p>
    <p id='cl2'>
        <strong>[Case Law 2]</strong><br>
        <em>Q:</em> A Hanafi Muslim dies leaving behind his wife, mother and father. Assign their shares.<br><br>
        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case involves the distribution of inheritance shares under Sunni (Hanafi)
        law for the deceased's close relatives.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> Under the Hanafi law of inheritance:<br>
        Wife inherits 1/4th if no children.<br>
        Mother inherits 1/3rd.<br>
        Father inherits the residue after other heirs’ shares are given.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong><br>
        Wife: 1/4th share.<br>
        Mother: 1/3rd of the remainder (after wife's share deducted).<br>
        Father: Remainder after wife and mother take their shares.<br>
        <strong>Calculation:</strong><br>
        Estate divided:<br>
        Wife gets 1/4th → Remaining 3/4th<br>
        Mother gets 1/3rd of 3/4th = 1/4th<br>
        Father gets the remaining 2/4th = 1/2<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
        Distribution:<br>
        Wife: 1/4<br>
        Mother: 1/4<br>
        Father: 1/2
    </p>
    <p id='cl3'>
        <strong>[Case Law 3]</strong><br>
        <em>Q:</em> ‘A’ domiciled in India, dies in France leaving movable property in France, movable property in
        England, and both movable and immovable property in India. What law governs succession?<br><br>
        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case is about determining the applicable succession law where a person
        domiciled in India dies leaving assets in multiple countries.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> Under Private International Law:<br>
        Movable property succession is governed by the law of domicile at death.<br>
        Immovable property succession is governed by the law of the place where the property is situated (lex
        situs).<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> Since 'A' had Indian domicile, movable properties (in France and England)
        will be governed by Indian law.<br>
        Immovable property in India will also be governed by Indian law.<br>
        (If there were immovable properties abroad, those would follow the law of the country where they are
        located.)<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Succession for all movable properties (France, England) and immovable properties in
        India is governed by Indian law.

        <em>Q:</em> 'A' acknowledges 'B' as his son and later revokes it. Is the revocation valid?<br><br>
        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case examines whether a Muslim’s acknowledgment of paternity can be revoked
        once made.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> Under Muslim Law:<br>
        Acknowledgement of paternity, once validly made, cannot be revoked.<br>
        It creates a permanent legal relationship unless fraud or mistake is proven.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> 'A' voluntarily acknowledged 'B' as his legitimate son.<br>
        There is no indication of fraud or mistake.<br>
        Therefore, the revocation attempted by 'A' is not recognized in law.<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The revocation is invalid. The acknowledgment of 'B' as the son stands permanently.

        <em>Q:</em> A Hanafi Muslim dies leaving behind his widow, son, and daughter. Assign their shares.<br><br>
        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case deals with inheritance distribution among close heirs under Hanafi
        Islamic Law.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> As per Hanafi Law:<br>
        Widow gets 1/8th if there are children.<br>
        Remaining estate is divided between the son and daughter at a ratio of 2:1.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> Widow: 1/8th share first.<br>
        Remaining 7/8th distributed:<br>
        Son gets double the share of the daughter.<br>
        Calculation:<br>
        Let the remaining 7/8th = 3 parts (2 parts for son, 1 part for daughter).<br>
        Thus:<br>
        Widow: 1/8<br>
        Son: 2/3 of 7/8<br>
        Daughter: 1/3 of 7/8<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Final distribution:<br>
        Widow: 1/8<br>
        Son: 2/3 of 7/8<br>
        Daughter: 1/3 of 7/8<br>
        (Or adjusted proportionally if simplified.)

        <em>Q:</em> A bequest is made to 'X' and his children. 'X' dies before the testator. His children survive. What
        is the effect of the bequest?<br><br>
        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case concerns the effect of a bequest when the intended beneficiary dies
        before the testator but leaves descendants.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> Under Muslim Law:<br>
        A bequest lapses if the legatee (beneficiary) predeceases the testator.<br>
        The doctrine of lapse applies — the gift does not automatically pass to the legatee's heirs unless specifically
        provided.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> 'X', the primary legatee, died before the testator.<br>
        Since the will does not explicitly provide for substitution in favor of X’s children, the bequest to X
        lapses.<br>
        The children cannot claim the bequest unless a fresh provision was made in their favor.<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The bequest lapses. The children of 'X' cannot inherit under the original bequest.

        <em>Q:</em> A Muslim marries his wife's sister during the lifetime of his wife. Two children are born. Are the
        children legitimate?<br><br>
        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case discusses the validity of marriage with a wife's sister during her
        lifetime and the legitimacy of the resulting children.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> Marriage with wife's sister during wife's lifetime is prohibited (prohibited
        degree of relationship) under Muslim Law.<br>
        Such a marriage is irregular (fasid), but not void.<br>
        Children from an irregular marriage are considered legitimate.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> Though the marriage is irregular because it violates prohibitions, the
        relationship still creates legitimacy for children born out of the union.<br>
        Therefore, the two children are legitimate.<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The marriage is irregular, but the children are legitimate under Muslim law.

        <em>Q:</em> A gift is made by a Muslim father to his minor son. Is delivery of possession necessary?<br><br>
        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case deals with the requirement of delivery of possession in gifts made by a
        father to his minor child.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> Under Muslim Law:<br>
        - Gift (hiba) must be accompanied by delivery of possession.<br>
        - Exception: No delivery is needed when a father gifts property to his minor child and retains possession as
        guardian.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> The father made a gift to his minor son and retained control as natural
        guardian.<br>
        Hence, physical delivery isn’t required.<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Delivery of possession is not essential when father makes gift to his minor child
        and holds it as guardian.

        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case concerns deathbed gifts (marz-ul-maut) and restrictions on their
        validity under Muslim Law.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> - Gift in death illness (marz-ul-maut) is subject to the same restrictions as
        a will.<br>
        - Maximum 1/3 of property can be given to non-heirs without consent of legal heirs.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> The gift was to a stranger and exceeded 1/3 of the estate.<br>
        No consent from heirs.<br>

        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case discusses the impact of marriage under the Special Marriage Act on
        succession laws.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> - Marriage under Special Marriage Act excludes application of personal
        laws.<br>
        - Indian Succession Act governs inheritance of persons married under the Special Marriage Act.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> The woman, being married under the Special Marriage Act, will not be
        governed by Muslim personal law for succession.<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The Indian Succession Act applies to her, not Muslim Law.

        own.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> - Under Muslim Law, gift of future property is invalid.<br>
        - The donor must have ownership at the time of gift.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> Since the property was not owned by the donor at the time of gift, it is

        valid?<br><br>
        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case relates to acknowledgment of paternity under Muslim Law where the child
        is known to be illegitimate.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> - Acknowledgement cannot be made to establish legitimacy of a known
        illegitimate child.<br>
        - The rule is that legitimacy cannot be created by acknowledgment when illegitimacy is clearly known.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> The boy is publicly known to be illegitimate. Acknowledgement by the
        alleged father will not make him legitimate.<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The acknowledgment is invalid and does not create a legal relationship.

        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case discusses the impact of long separation on a Muslim marriage where
        talaq has not been pronounced.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> - Mere separation does not dissolve marriage under Muslim law.<br>
        - Divorce must be formally pronounced through talaq, judicial divorce, or khula.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> Since no talaq or judicial decree was obtained, separation alone does not
        end the marriage.<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> No, the marriage is not automatically dissolved by separation.
