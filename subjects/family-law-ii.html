        <em>Q:</em> Define Dower. Explain the Various Kinds of Dower<br><br>

        <em>Answer:</em><br>

        1. Introduction to Dower (Mahr)<br>
        2. Definition of Dower<br>
        3. Nature and Importance of Dower<br>
        4. Legal Characteristics of Dower<br>
        5. Classification of Dower under Muslim Law:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Specified Dower (Mahr-e-Musamma)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Proper Dower (Mahr-e-Misl)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. Prompt Dower (Mahr-e-Mu’ajjal)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Deferred Dower (Mahr-e-Muwajjal)<br>
        6. Remedies for Non-Payment of Dower<br>
        7. Important Case Laws<br>
        8. Conclusion<br><br>

        <strong>1. Introduction to Dower (Mahr):</strong><br>
        Under Muslim law, marriage (Nikah) is a civil contract. However, unlike other civil contracts, it has some
        unique features. One of them is the concept of dower, known in Arabic as "Mahr". It is not merely a formality,
        but a legal obligation imposed on the husband as a mark of respect and protection for the wife.<br><br>

        <strong>2. Definition of Dower:</strong><br>
        Dower is defined as a sum of money or other property which the wife is entitled to receive from the husband as
        an obligation upon marriage, either by agreement or by operation of law. <br>
        <em>According to Hedaya:</em> “Mahr is a sum of money or other property which becomes payable by the husband to
        the wife as a mark of respect towards her.”<br><br>

        <strong>3. Nature and Importance of Dower:</strong><br>
        • It is not a consideration for marriage but an obligation.<br>
        • It is a wife’s right, which is enforceable by law.<br>
        • Even if not mentioned in the marriage contract, the wife is entitled to proper dower.<br>
        • Serves as a security for the wife’s future.<br>
        • Acts as a deterrent against arbitrary divorce by the husband.
        <br><br>

        <strong>4. Legal Characteristics of Dower:</strong><br>
        • It is payable only to the wife, not to her relatives.<br>
        • It may be in the form of money, property, or anything of value.<br>
        • It becomes a debt against the husband.<br>
        • The wife can refuse to cohabit until prompt dower is paid.<br>
        • If the husband dies without paying it, the wife can claim it from his estate.
        <br><br>

        <strong>5. Classification of Dower under Muslim Law:</strong><br><br>
        Dower can be classified broadly into two main categories:<br>
        <strong>A. Specified Dower (Mahr-e-Musamma):</strong><br>
        • This is the dower fixed by agreement between the parties before or at the time of marriage.<br>
        • It may be fixed by:<br>
        o Mutual agreement of husband and wife,<br>
        o Or by the guardians on their behalf.<br>
        • It may be prompt or deferred, or a combination of both.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Legal Position:</strong><br>
        • If specified, it becomes binding on the husband.<br>
        • Cannot be less than 10 dirhams under classical Hanafi law (though no minimum is fixed under Indian law).<br><br>

        <strong>B. Proper Dower (Mahr-e-Misl):</strong><br>
        • When no dower is fixed, or the agreement is invalid, the wife is entitled to proper dower.<br>
        • It is determined with reference to the status of the wife.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Factors considered:</strong><br>
        • Dower received by female relatives (sisters, paternal aunts, cousins),<br>
        • Wife’s age, beauty, social standing, education, and property,<br>
        • Custom and social conditions.<br>
        <strong>Legal Position:</strong><br>
        • This type of dower is fixed by the court and becomes payable upon consummation or death.<br><br>

        <strong>C. Prompt Dower (Mahr-e-Mu’ajjal):</strong><br>
        • This is the portion of dower which is payable immediately after marriage or on demand.<br>
        • The wife can refuse to enter the matrimonial home until it is paid.<br>
        <strong>Legal Rights:</strong><br>
        • The wife has a right to refuse cohabitation until it is paid.<br>
        • Can sue for recovery of prompt dower during the husband's lifetime.<br>
        • If not paid, it remains a debt on the husband and can be recovered from his estate after death.
        <br>
        <em>Case Law:</em> <strong>Abdul Kadir v. Salima (1886) ILR 8 All 149</strong> – Wife can refuse cohabitation
        until prompt dower is paid.<br><br>

        <strong>D. Deferred Dower (Mahr-e-Muwajjal):</strong><br>
        • This is the portion of dower payable at a later time, usually:<br>
        o At the dissolution of marriage, or<br>
        o On the death of the husband.<br>
        <strong>Legal Rights:</strong><br>
        • The wife cannot demand it during the continuance of marriage unless otherwise agreed.<br>
        • It becomes a debt payable upon divorce or death.<br>
        • The wife has a right to retain possession of the husband's property until the deferred dower is paid.
        <br>
        <em>Case Law:</em> <strong>Nasra Begum v. Rizwan Ali, AIR 1980 All 202</strong> – Wife allowed to retain
        possession for unpaid deferred dower.<br><br>

        <strong>6. Remedies for Non-Payment of Dower:</strong><br>
        If dower is not paid, the wife can:<br>
        1. Refuse cohabitation (in case of prompt dower).<br>
        2. File a suit for recovery in a civil court.<br>
        3. Retain possession of husband's property (right of retention).<br>
        4. Claim from the husband's estate after his death as an unsecured creditor.<br>
        The dower has priority over the claims of other heirs, and can be recovered even after the death of the husband.<br>
        <br><br>

        <strong>7. Important Case Laws:</strong><br>
        • <strong>Abdul Kadir v. Salima (1886) ILR 8 All 149</strong> – Dower is a legal obligation.<br>
        • <strong>Hamira Bibi v. Zubaida Bibi (1916) 43 IA 294</strong> – Dower is enforceable like debt.<br>
        • <strong>Nasra Begum v. Rizwan Ali, AIR 1980 All 202</strong> – Wife can retain possession for unpaid
        dower.<br><br>

        <strong>8. Conclusion:</strong><br>
        Dower or mahr is a unique and essential element of Muslim marriage. It is not a bride price, but a symbol of
        respect and financial security for the wife. Muslim law recognizes several kinds of dower—specified, proper,
        prompt, and deferred—each with distinct rules. Dower is enforceable as a legal debt and the wife has effective
        remedies for non-payment. Thus, dower plays a vital role in balancing rights and protecting the dignity of women
        in Muslim law.

        <em>Q:</em> Explain Various Sources of Mohammedan Law<br><br>

        <em>Answer:</em><br>

        <strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong><br>
        1. Introduction to Mohammedan Law<br>
        2. Classification of Sources<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Primary Sources (Ancient)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Secondary Sources (Ancient & Modern)<br>
        3. The Quran<br>
        4. The Sunnah (Traditions)<br>
        5. Ijma (Consensus of Jurists)<br>
        6. Qiyas (Analogical Deduction)<br>
        7. Custom (Urf or Aadat)<br>
        8. Equity, Justice, and Good Conscience<br>
        9. Precedent (Judicial Decisions)<br>
        10. Legislation (Statutory Law)<br>
        11. Conclusion<br><br>

        <strong>1. Introduction:</strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammedan Law, also known as Muslim Personal Law, governs Muslims in matters related to
        marriage, divorce,
        maintenance, inheritance, succession, guardianship, wills, and gifts. It is a divine law, believed to be
        revealed by Allah to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), and followed by all Muslims.
        The law is derived from a combination of divine revelations and human interpretations, which are collectively
        referred to as the sources of Mohammedan Law. These sources have developed over time and are recognized under
        both Sunni and Shia schools, though there may be differences in their interpretation.<br>
    
        <br><br>

        <strong>2. Classification of Sources:</strong><br>
        The sources of Mohammedan Law can be broadly classified into:<br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A. Primary (Ancient) Sources:</strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Quran – Holy Book of Islam<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Sunnah – Traditions of the Prophet<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Ijma – Consensus of Jurists<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Qiyas – Analogical reasoning<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>B. Secondary Sources:</strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Custom (Urf or Aadat)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Equity, Justice, and Good Conscience<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Precedents (Judicial decisions)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Legislation (Modern statutes)<br>
        <br><br>

        <strong>3. The Quran (Primary Source):</strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Quran is the supreme and most authoritative source of Muslim law. It is the word of
        God as revealed to
        Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) through Angel Jibreel (Gabriel).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• It contains rules related to marriage, divorce, inheritance, dower, contracts, trade, and
        punishment.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• There are about 500 verses dealing with legal issues.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• When there is a clear command in the Quran, it is final and binding.<br>
        <strong>Example</strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• Surah An-Nisa (4:11) prescribes inheritance shares for heirs.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• Surah Al-Baqarah (2:228) lays down the iddat period for divorced women.
        .<br><br>

        <strong>4. The Sunnah (Traditions of the Prophet):</strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sunnah refers to the sayings, actions, and approvals of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
        These
        traditions are recorded
        in Hadith literature.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• It is the second most important source after the Quran.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• It explains and supplements the Quranic injunctions.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• There are Sahih (authentic), Hasan (good), and Daif (weak) categories of Hadiths.<br>
        <strong>Example</strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• The Prophet said: "Marriage is my Sunnah; whoever shuns it is not from me."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• Prophet's actions clarified the manner of offering prayers, distribution of inheritance, etc.<br>
        <br><br>

        <strong>5. Ijma (Consensus of Jurists):</strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ijma means the consensus or agreement of learned Muslim scholars (jurists or Mujtahids)
        of a
        particular generation
        on a point of Islamic law.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• It arises when the Quran and Sunnah do not provide a direct answer.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• Once a consensus is reached, it becomes a binding source of law.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• Accepted mostly by Sunni schools and restricted in scope under Shia law.<br>
        <strong>Example</strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• Fixing the punishment for drinking alcohol (which is not expressly fixed in Quran) was done
        through
        Ijma.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Ijma is supported by the Hadith:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;"My followers will never agree upon what is wrong."
        <br><br>

        <strong>6. Qiyas (Analogical Deduction):</strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qiyas means reasoning by analogy. It is used when a case is not directly covered by the
        Quran, Sunnah, or Ijma.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• A known injunction is applied to a new case having a similar cause (illah).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• It is accepted in Sunni schools, but rejected by Shia, who rely on reason (Aql) instead.<br>
        <strong>Example</strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• Prohibition of wine is extended to all intoxicants because the cause (illah) is intoxication.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Qiyas ensures that Islamic law can respond to new situations.
        <br><br>

        <strong>7.Custom (Urf or Aadat):</strong><br>
        Customs that are not opposed to the Quran and Sunnah are accepted as valid supplementary sources.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• Recognized in the early Islamic period and retained where appropriate.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• The custom must be ancient, reasonable, certain, and not opposed to public policy or Islamic
        principles.<br>
        <strong>Example</strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• Mehr (dower) amounts vary based on customary practices in different regions.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• Kashmiri Muslim widows are allowed to inherit the estate during lifetime, due to local custom.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;However, Section 2 of the Shariat Act, 1937 has restricted the application of custom in many
        matters.
        <br><br>

        <strong>8. Equity, Justice, and Good Conscience:</strong><br>
        When there is no clear rule available from Quran, Sunnah, Ijma, or Qiyas, courts may rely on the principles of
        equity, justice, and good conscience.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• It allows application of rational fairness, especially in modern times.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• It is not originally Islamic, but has been applied by British Indian courts.<br>
        <strong>Example</strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• Courts granted maintenance to divorced Muslim wives under Section 125 of CrPC, as seen in Shah
        Bano
        case.
        <br><br>

        <strong>9. Precedents (Judicial Decisions):</strong><br>
        Under British colonial rule, and now in independent India, judicial decisions have contributed to shaping
        Mohammedan
        law.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• Courts have clarified many unclear areas of law.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• These decisions are binding precedents under the Indian legal system.<br>
        <strong>Example</strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• Sarla Mudgal v. Union of India: Supreme Court held that conversion to Islam to enter a second
        marriage without<br>
        dissolving the first marriage is void under Indian Penal Code Section 494.
        <br><br>

        <strong>10. Legislation (Statutory Law):</strong><br>
        Modern legislation has modified and codified parts of Muslim Personal Law in India.<br>
        Important Statutes Include:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• The Shariat Act, 1937 – Enforces application of Muslim personal law to marriage, divorce,
        inheritance, etc.,
        instead of customs.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 – Passed after the Shah Bano
        case.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939 – Gives Muslim women the right to seek judicial
        divorce.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;• The Wakf Act, 1995 – Regulates the administration of Wakf properties.<br>
        Though Muslim personal law is mostly uncodified, these legislations have clarified and supplemented the
        traditional
        Islamic sources.
        <br><br>

        <strong>11. Conclusion:</strong><br>
        The sources of Mohammedan Law are a combination of divine revelations and human reasoning, ensuring both
        authenticity and adaptability. The Quran and Sunnah are the foundational sources, while Ijma and Qiyas provide
        flexibility. Customs, precedents, and legislation have helped in adapting the law to contemporary realities.
        These sources together form a comprehensive and evolving legal system that continues to guide personal law for
        Muslims in India.<br>

    <p id='cl1'>
        <strong>[Case Law 1]</strong><br>
        <em>Q:</em> A Hanafi Muslim who has four wives, contracts a fifth wife. Is the fifth marriage valid?<br><br>
        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case concerns the validity of a fifth marriage contracted by a Hanafi Muslim
        male who already has four wives.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> Under Islamic Law (particularly Hanafi law), a Muslim man is permitted to
        have up to four wives simultaneously. The Quran (Surah An-Nisa 4:3) allows polygyny but restricts the number to
        four. Marrying more than four is prohibited.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> Since the individual already has four wives, entering into a fifth
        marriage violates the restriction prescribed in the Quran. Such a marriage is not merely irregular but void
        (batil) under Muslim law because it contravenes the basic limit.<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The fifth marriage contracted by the Hanafi Muslim is void and has no legal
        validity. Any marital rights or obligations arising from it are unenforceable.

        <em>Q:</em> A Hanafi Muslim dies leaving behind his wife, mother and father. Assign their shares.<br><br>
        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case involves the distribution of inheritance shares under Sunni (Hanafi)
        law for the deceased's close relatives.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> Under the Hanafi law of inheritance:<br>
        Wife inherits 1/4th if no children.<br>
        Mother inherits 1/3rd.<br>
        Father inherits the residue after other heirs’ shares are given.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong><br>
        Wife: 1/4th share.<br>
        Mother: 1/3rd of the remainder (after wife's share deducted).<br>
        Father: Remainder after wife and mother take their shares.<br>
        <strong>Calculation:</strong><br>
        Estate divided:<br>
        Wife gets 1/4th → Remaining 3/4th<br>
        Mother gets 1/3rd of 3/4th = 1/4th<br>
        Father gets the remaining 2/4th = 1/2<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
        Distribution:<br>
        Wife: 1/4<br>
        Mother: 1/4<br>
        Father: 1/2

        <em>Q:</em> ‘A’ domiciled in India, dies in France leaving movable property in France, movable property in
        England, and both movable and immovable property in India. What law governs succession?<br><br>
        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case is about determining the applicable succession law where a person
        domiciled in India dies leaving assets in multiple countries.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> Under Private International Law:<br>
        Movable property succession is governed by the law of domicile at death.<br>
        Immovable property succession is governed by the law of the place where the property is situated (lex
        situs).<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> Since 'A' had Indian domicile, movable properties (in France and England)
        will be governed by Indian law.<br>
        Immovable property in India will also be governed by Indian law.<br>
        (If there were immovable properties abroad, those would follow the law of the country where they are
        located.)<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Succession for all movable properties (France, England) and immovable properties in
        India is governed by Indian law.

        <strong>[Case Law 4]</strong><br>
        <em>Q:</em> 'A' acknowledges 'B' as his son and later revokes it. Is the revocation valid?<br><br>
        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case examines whether a Muslim’s acknowledgment of paternity can be revoked
        once made.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> Under Muslim Law:<br>
        Acknowledgement of paternity, once validly made, cannot be revoked.<br>
        It creates a permanent legal relationship unless fraud or mistake is proven.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> 'A' voluntarily acknowledged 'B' as his legitimate son.<br>
        There is no indication of fraud or mistake.<br>
        Therefore, the revocation attempted by 'A' is not recognized in law.<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The revocation is invalid. The acknowledgment of 'B' as the son stands permanently.

        <strong>[Case Law 5]</strong><br>
        <em>Q:</em> A Hanafi Muslim dies leaving behind his widow, son, and daughter. Assign their shares.<br><br>
        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case deals with inheritance distribution among close heirs under Hanafi
        Islamic Law.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> As per Hanafi Law:<br>
        Widow gets 1/8th if there are children.<br>
        Remaining estate is divided between the son and daughter at a ratio of 2:1.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> Widow: 1/8th share first.<br>
        Remaining 7/8th distributed:<br>
        Son gets double the share of the daughter.<br>
        Calculation:<br>
        Let the remaining 7/8th = 3 parts (2 parts for son, 1 part for daughter).<br>
        Thus:<br>
        Widow: 1/8<br>
        Son: 2/3 of 7/8<br>
        Daughter: 1/3 of 7/8<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Final distribution:<br>
        Widow: 1/8<br>
        Son: 2/3 of 7/8<br>
        Daughter: 1/3 of 7/8<br>
        (Or adjusted proportionally if simplified.)

        <strong>[Case Law 6]</strong><br>
        <em>Q:</em> A bequest is made to 'X' and his children. 'X' dies before the testator. His children survive. What
        is the effect of the bequest?<br><br>
        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case concerns the effect of a bequest when the intended beneficiary dies
        before the testator but leaves descendants.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> Under Muslim Law:<br>
        A bequest lapses if the legatee (beneficiary) predeceases the testator.<br>
        The doctrine of lapse applies — the gift does not automatically pass to the legatee's heirs unless specifically
        provided.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> 'X', the primary legatee, died before the testator.<br>
        Since the will does not explicitly provide for substitution in favor of X’s children, the bequest to X
        lapses.<br>
        The children cannot claim the bequest unless a fresh provision was made in their favor.<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The bequest lapses. The children of 'X' cannot inherit under the original bequest.

        <em>Q:</em> A Muslim marries his wife's sister during the lifetime of his wife. Two children are born. Are the
        children legitimate?<br><br>
        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case discusses the validity of marriage with a wife's sister during her
        lifetime and the legitimacy of the resulting children.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> Marriage with wife's sister during wife's lifetime is prohibited (prohibited
        degree of relationship) under Muslim Law.<br>
        Such a marriage is irregular (fasid), but not void.<br>
        Children from an irregular marriage are considered legitimate.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> Though the marriage is irregular because it violates prohibitions, the
        relationship still creates legitimacy for children born out of the union.<br>
        Therefore, the two children are legitimate.<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The marriage is irregular, but the children are legitimate under Muslim law.

        <strong>[Case Law 8]</strong><br>
        <em>Q:</em> A gift is made by a Muslim father to his minor son. Is delivery of possession necessary?<br><br>
        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case deals with the requirement of delivery of possession in gifts made by a
        father to his minor child.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> Under Muslim Law:<br>
        - Gift (hiba) must be accompanied by delivery of possession.<br>
        - Exception: No delivery is needed when a father gifts property to his minor child and retains possession as
        guardian.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> The father made a gift to his minor son and retained control as natural
        guardian.<br>
        Hence, physical delivery isn’t required.<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Delivery of possession is not essential when father makes gift to his minor child
        and holds it as guardian.

        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case concerns deathbed gifts (marz-ul-maut) and restrictions on their
        validity under Muslim Law.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> - Gift in death illness (marz-ul-maut) is subject to the same restrictions as
        a will.<br>
        - Maximum 1/3 of property can be given to non-heirs without consent of legal heirs.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> The gift was to a stranger and exceeded 1/3 of the estate.<br>
        No consent from heirs.<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The gift is invalid to the extent it exceeds 1/3 of the estate.

        Succession Act?<br><br>
        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case discusses the impact of marriage under the Special Marriage Act on
        succession laws.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> - Marriage under Special Marriage Act excludes application of personal
        laws.<br>
        - Indian Succession Act governs inheritance of persons married under the Special Marriage Act.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> The woman, being married under the Special Marriage Act, will not be
        governed by Muslim personal law for succession.<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The Indian Succession Act applies to her, not Muslim Law.

        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case deals with oral gifts and their enforceability under Muslim Law.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> - Oral gifts are valid if the 3 essentials of hiba are satisfied:<br>
        (i) Declaration<br>
        (ii) Acceptance<br>
        (iii) Delivery of possession<br>
        - Writing is not essential.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> If witnesses prove the oral gift and delivery of possession, the gift is

        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case relates to the legality of gifting property that the donor does not yet
        own.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> - Under Muslim Law, gift of future property is invalid.<br>
        - The donor must have ownership at the time of gift.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> Since the property was not owned by the donor at the time of gift, it is
        not a valid hiba.<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Gift of future property is void in Muslim law.

        <em>Q:</em> A Muslim acknowledges paternity of a boy who is known to be illegitimate. Is the acknowledgment
        valid?<br><br>
        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case relates to acknowledgment of paternity under Muslim Law where the child
        is known to be illegitimate.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> - Acknowledgement cannot be made to establish legitimacy of a known
        illegitimate child.<br>
        - The rule is that legitimacy cannot be created by acknowledgment when illegitimacy is clearly known.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> The boy is publicly known to be illegitimate. Acknowledgement by the
        alleged father will not make him legitimate.<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The acknowledgment is invalid and does not create a legal relationship.

        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case discusses the impact of long separation on a Muslim marriage where
        talaq has not been pronounced.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> - Mere separation does not dissolve marriage under Muslim law.<br>
        - Divorce must be formally pronounced through talaq, judicial divorce, or khula.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> Since no talaq or judicial decree was obtained, separation alone does not
        end the marriage.<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> No, the marriage is not automatically dissolved by separation.

        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case examines the legal position on revocation of talaq before iddat
        expires.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> - Under Muslim law, a talaq pronounced can be revoked during iddat by words
        or conduct (resumption of cohabitation).<br>
        - No fresh nikah is required.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> If revocation was made before iddat expired, it is legally valid and the
        marriage continues.<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Yes, talaq can be revoked during iddat and the revocation is valid.

        <em>Answer:</em><br>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This case relates to whether talaq pronounced without serious intent is valid
        under Muslim law.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> - Talaq pronounced in jest, or without serious intention, is effective under
        classical Hanafi law.<br>
        - However, modern interpretation and judicial approach may differ.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> The husband pronounced talaq in anger. If intention and understanding
        were present, it is effective.<br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Talaq in anger is valid unless it can be proved that mental control was completely
        lost.

        Muslim law.<br>
        <strong>Legal Principles:</strong> - Under Section 2 of the 1939 Act, a wife can seek divorce if the husband is
        impotent at the time of marriage and continues to be so.<br>
        - Court may grant a decree if impotency is proved.<br>
        <strong>Application of Facts:</strong> The husband is shown to be impotent and no cure has occurred.<br>
